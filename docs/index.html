<a id="example-start"></a>


<p>
	Ok so, I started writing a technical paper about this new language, but let's cut to the chase - 
	you're here because you want to write a simple little script to control something on your base or ship.
	 Here's how you do it. Let's learn by example.
</p>
<p>Let's say we have a door that we want to monitor, and pressurize a room whenever it's activated. The first thing is to head back to the <a href="../">generator page</a> and select Door and Air Vent. Generate, copy, and paste into a programmable block. When you save and compile, you should see "Hello from init script!" in the programmable block's terminal. <a href="../report-issue/">No?</a> </p>

<p>
	The next step is to pick a block where you want to write your program. I usually use button panels, since it can both store, and start, the program with one click. Programs can be written in the Custom Data of any block. So, slap down a button, go to its terminal, and open Custom Data. Now, we're ready to code.
</p>

<p>
	Now, let's say we've named our door "Air Lock Door". So how do we check it?
	Well, the first thing is, we need a way to refer to that thing in our code.
	So we create a variable.
</p>
<code>var door;</code>
<p>
	This is programming 101, but it's an important step. This will be how we refer to that door.
	But it's just an empty variable right now. We need it to point to our actual door.
</p>
<p>
	And that's where the <code>$</code> operator comes in. <br/>
	<code>$</code> means "system" and it's how we interact with space engineers.
	Since this is an in-game script, that pretty much means the terminal system, i.e. the thing you see when you open a control panel.
	Anything you put after the <code>$</code> will return the block with that name (or a block group, but that's a write-only object).
	If you put a hard-coded name in quotes, like<br>
	<code>$"Air Lock Door"</code>, that will get the door object.
	Or, you could pass a variable, like <br>
	<code>var x = "Air Lock Door"; $x.Status</code>..., 
	maybe, if you want to have configurable block names or something.
</p>
<p>
	So, after all that explanation, let's set our variable to be the actual door.
</p>
<code>door = $"Air Lock Door";</code>
<p>
	Note the semicolon <code>;</code> at the end. That's important. It marks the end of a statement, or "line" of code. Some languages use them, others don't. Since you may be typing programs on a single line into a programmable block's argument box, I decided to use them, rather than requiring one statement per line.
</p>
<p>
	So, now our variable 'door' refers to the actual block named "Air Lock Door". We could open it if we want to...
</p>
<code>door.OpenDoor();</code>
<p>
	The period <code>.</code> means "look inside this object for what I type next." <code>OpenDoor</code> is a function of doors, and 
	the parentheses <code>()</code> mean "do that function".<br>
	...But anyway, we don't want to open the door. We want to watch for when its status changes.
	Fortunately, door blocks give us a "Status" property.
	We could run an infinite loop and use 100% of our cpu constantly checking it,
	but here's where another feature of the BreakStep language comes in:
	the <code>watch</code> keyword. This will let us take action whenever something changes.
</p>
<code>
	watch (door.Status) { ... }
</code>
<p>Now, anything we put inside the <code>{ ... }</code> will run when the door's status changes. So let's move on to the air vent.
	Looking at <a href="https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/wiki/Namespace-Index">this wonderful documentation</a> and searching for "airvent",
	we see a property called "Depressurize". That looks like what we're after!
	<br> Side note: All properties in Space Engineers start with a Capital Letter.
</p>
<code>$"Air Lock Vent".Depressurize = 1;</code>
TODO: true/false are not keywords, just use 1 or 0.
<p>
	Of course, we don't always want to depressurize the room. We need to check if the door is open or closed.
	In other words, if its Status equals "Closed". Note: The status could also be "Opening" or "Closing", but we want to see if it's fully closed.
	Meaning the double equals <code>==</code> sign. A single <code>=</code> is a command, it assigns right to left. A double <code>==</code> is a question, yes or no, true or false, 1 or 0.
</p>

<a id="example-code"></a>
<p>
		So, putting it all together:
</p>	
<pre><code>var door = $"Air Lock Door";
watch (door.Status)
{
	if (door.Status == "Closed")
	{
		$"Air Lock Vent".Depressurize = 0;
	}
	else
	{
		$"Air Lock Vent".Depressurize = 1;
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>
	You could also add an indicator light:<br>
	<code>$"Door Light".Color = #00FF00;</code><br>
	You can use HTML color codes for colors. For more see "Numbers" below.

</p>
<p>
	So now we've got all our code written. There's just one more thing to do: Run it!
</p>
<p>
	On your button panel where you wrote the program, go into its actions and drag the BreakStep programmable block onto the button of your choice.
	The action will be "Run", which should give you a popup asking for an argument. This is how we tell the script loader what to run.
	The argument is just a program itself, so you could put an entire program on one line and run it that way. But there's a
	special command, <code>run</code>, that will start a new script. It goes like this:<br>
	<code>run "Button Panel 1";</code><br>
	Note the quotes and semicolon. Theoretically, you could have the name of the block in a variable and <code>run MyBlockName;</code>, but
	that's getting off topic. 99% of the time, you'll just tell it to run the button panel you're on.
</p>

<p>
	So now, your program will happily sit idle in the background, waiting for that door to open, and responding when it does. Congratulations! 
	Of course, in reality you'd probably have two doors, and the logic would be slightly more complicated, maybe with some sensors, but
	now you know how to work with a block's properties so you can make it do anything!
</p>

<p>
	Now, there's one more trick: printing to an LCD Panel. If you want to actually print something, you'll need to set that up in the argument. Here's the command for that;<br>
	<code>on LCD Panel 2: run "Button Panel 2";</code><br>
	The LCD block does not go in quotes, but you need to put that colon <code>:</code> after it. Now if you print() from your script, it will go there.
	You can also say <code>on LCD Panel: print(1+2+3);</code> or any one-line program. Anyway, I hope that's enough to get you started.
</p>

<p>
	Programming is something that feels intimidating at first, but once you see something that you wrote in action, it will all be worth it.
	Have fun out there, and get creative!
</p>



<h1 id="bslang">The BreakStep language</h1>

<p>
	BreakStep is an interpreted language that runs on top of a C# / .net environment. This choice was made for a very specific application where C# can be used to write plugins and scripts for the game Space Engineers. C# is also the native language of the Unity game engine, so more opportunities may present themselves over time.
</p>
<p>
	So what is this new language? Basically, it's a weakly typed, c- or js-style syntax with a few key differences outlined below
	You'll be typing lots of <code>()</code> and <code>{}</code> and <code>;</code> rather than saying
	<code>then</code> or <code>do</code> or relying on tabs.
</p>

<h3 id="adds-features">The cool things it adds:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Execution as a state machine. This is where the name comes from.
		The parent system can run as many steps as it wants and break out whenever needed.
		The cpu cycles can be spread out where available. The controlling process advances the clock.
		This does come at a cost though, see Performance below.
	</li>
	<li><code>$</code> The system resolver operator. It's a shorthand for the most commonly used system call that takes one argument and returns 0 or 1 result. Being such a niche language for now, there is often a narrow scope of interest to the user, and this just makes life easier. I want my block. <code>$"My Block"</code>, bam. </li>
	<li><code>wait x;</code> - pauses for x seconds. Decimals are ok. <code>x</code> can be any expression. </li>
	<li><code>watch(expression) { code... }</code> - executes the code inside the <code>{}</code> braces whenever a value changes. *Note: This requires some implementation details to call a poll function or set up some kind of event system, but users don't have to worry about that.</li>
	<li>functional expressions without <code>return</code> - e.g. <code>function square(x) { x*x }</code>. Some languages like Rust also do this, I'm aware. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="does-not-have">What Breakstep doesn't have:</h3>
<p>If you haven't done much coding before, you might not miss any of these, but I really can't say "just write javascript" and leave these out. So here's a few things you'll have to work around: </p>
<ul>
	<li> <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> - for complicated reasons, a postfix increment would require weird special cases and it's just more code... size is a premium here. I feel like I have to apologize for this, because even I have made the mistake of writing a <code>for</code> loop on autopilot and typing <code>i++</code> at the end out of habit. Maybe I'll add it later, if it doesn't take too much space. Just say <code>i+=1;</code> </li>
	<li><code>switch / case</code> - You'll just have to get by with <code>if / else if / else</code></li>
	<li>Ternary expressions <code>a ? b : c</code> , although you can put <code>if</code> statements inline anywhere. Just leave out the last semicolon to return an expression. <br/>
		For example, <code>var x = if (y > 0) {y} else { doSomething(); 0 } </code>
		... Note, the braces <code>{}</code> are required in this case, even for a simple expression like 'y'.<br/>
		<code>need_braces = if (returning_a_value) { true } else do_your_thing(); not_part_of_if_block(); </code>

	</li>
	<li><code>()=>expression</code> syntax (but you can still define a function anywhere, including an argument list, so lambdas are possible)</li>
	<li><code>[]</code> and <code>{}</code> initializers and inline JSON-style objects. Any variable can become an object or array by treating it as such, but you'll have to assign each member in its own statement. <br/>
		<code>var car; car.speed = 80; car.color = "red"; ...</code></li>
	<li><code>let</code> keyword, just use <code>var</code> to declare variables</li>
	<li><code>const</code> keyword</li>
	<li><code>await/async</code></li>
	<li>Promises (unless someone writes a library; the interpreter doesn't know or care about the concept.)</li>
	<li>Object-oriented features like <code>class</code>, <code>this</code>, and <code>self</code>. Although any variable can act as an object and hold member functions, it won't be able to refer to itself unless that's one of the parameters, like <code>cow.moo(cow);</code> <br>
		I'd like to reserve <code>this</code> and <code>self</code> for future use, though, just in case. So try to avoid using them as variable names in your code.
	</li>
	<li>TODO: <code>try / catch</code></li>
	<li>TODO: <code>import / export</code> But you do have <code>run "sourceName";</code> This could be used with some shared memory location or file (like watch(a random block's Custom Data){...} ) to pass arguments and results. </li>
</ul>










<h1 id="syntax">Crash course on syntax</h1>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
... work like C-style languages:
<pre><code>var x; // Two slashes make a comment

/* This is also a comment */  var x = This_is_code();

/* This is also a comment
   on multiple lines */

</code></pre>

<h3 id="loops">Branching and loops</h3>

<p>
	<pre><code>if (condition)
{
  block_of_code();
  multiple_statements();
}
else if (condition)
  one_line();
else
{
  0
}
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
	There's a space in <code>else if</code>. Parentheses around the condition are required.
	The braces are not necessary if the block of code is only one statement, but it's good practice to always put them.
	Braces are required if "returning" a value from the <code>if</code> block. To make any <code>{}</code> block evaluate to a particular value,
	just omit the semicolon on the final statement.
</p>

<p>
	<code>while (condition) { loop code }</code> Traditional C-style while loop.
</p>
<p>
	<code>do { loop code } while (condition);</code><br>
	<code>do {loop code } until (condition); </code><br>
	Runs the loop code at least once, and checks condition after. <code>until (condition)</code> is the same as <code>while (!condition)</code>
</p>

<p>
	<code>for (initial statement; condition; loop advance statement) { ... } </code><br>
	C-style for loop. There is no support for <code>foreach/in/of</code>, although a <code>foreach</code> could theoretically
	be written as a support function in BreakStep itself.
</p>

<h3 id="order">
	Order of definition
</h3>
<p>
	If a function is defined as "first class", meaning <code>function MyFunction() { ... }</code>, then it can be
	called from anywhere in the scope, even from above where it's defined. If it's a variable, however:<br>
	<code>var MyFunc = function() { ... }</code>, then it must have been previously declared above where it is called.
</p>

<pre><code>FirstClass();  // ok
function FirstClass() {...}

MyFunctionVar(); // error, variable not found
var MyFunctionVar = function() {...}

var SecondFunction;
SecondFunction();  // No error, but won't do anything. 
SecondFunction = function() { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>
	In the last case, it will try to parse a function call when it sees the parentheses (), but since the variable has not been assigned a function yet,
	it will just give up. This should probably be an error, but it should be considered undefined behavior for now.
</p>

<h3 id="operators">
	Operators
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Most operators work the same as in C or Java/script, with the notable exception of xor.<br></li>
	<li><code>^</code> does exponentiation (raise to a power)</li>
	<li><code>+^</code> is the bitwise xor. <code>^^</code> is the logical or.<br></li>
	<li>Arithmetic and bitwise operators can be combined with = to assign, but not boolean/logical operators.<br>
	This includes <code> +=, *=, -=, /=, &=, |=, ^= (exponent) +^= (xor), &lt;&lt;= (shift left), and &gt;&gt;= (shift right)  </code></li>
	<li>The words <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>, and <code>xor</code> are also logical boolean operators.</li>
	<li><code>@variable and @=</code> Creates a reference to a variable instead of copying by value. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="numbers">Numbers</h3>
<p>
	Numbers are usually represented internally as doubles, i.e. 64-bit floating point values. In certain cases, if the parser detects
	a value &gt;= 2^52 and &lt;=2^64, and the token does not contain a decimal point,
	it will re-parse the value as a 64-bit integer. Any C# code that assigns a 'long' type to a Var object
	will invoke the long integer storage mechanism.
</p>
<p>
	Boolean values are just numbers. 0 is false, anything else is true. Any boolean operator results in 1 or 0.
</p>
<p>
	HTML color codes can be annotated with <code>#</code> in either the 3-digit or 6-digit form.
	The internal byte order will be reversed when you do this, so they should only be used for actual colors.
</p>
<p>
	Other hex values can be written as 0x1FC3...
</p>

<h3 id="references">References</h3>
<p>
	
	When you say <code>a = b;</code>, b is value copied to a. For objects and arrays, this means an element-wise copy
	of every value. If you want to pass the actual object, use <code>@</code>. <br>
	<code>var a @= b;</code> Now <code>a</code> will reflect changes to <code>b</code> and vice versa.<br>
	You can also say <code>a = @b;</code>

</p>
<p>
	Note: Certain system objects are always carried as references. For example: <br>
	<code>var light = $"Internal Light";</code> The <code>light</code> variable will now
	represent that system object. Assigning
	to <code>light.Color</code> will affect the light. However,<br>
	<code>var color = light.Color; color = #FFF;</code> In this case, <code>color</code> will
	not affect the original object. It will if you use the <code>@=</code> or <code>@</code> operator, though.
</p>
<pre><code>var color @= $"Internal Light".Color;
color = #FFF;
</code></pre>
or...
<pre><code>var color = @$"Internal Light".Color
color = #F0F0F0;
</code></pre>


<h3 id="objects-null">Objects and null</h3>
Consider the following example:<br>
<code>var x; x.a.b = 42;</code><br>
In most languages, this would throw a null reference exception.
Here, though, a write operation will create every object along the chain.
So then, <code>x.a</code> would print as <code>Object[1]</code> and <code>keys(x.a)</code> would return "b".
Keys that don't exist do evaluate internally to null values, but writing to it creates it.

<h3 id="closures">Closures, lambdas, and callbacks</h3>
<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 1)
  {
    var x = i; // Make a separate copy of i
    someProcess(function() { println(x); });
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
	There are currently no system calls that accept callbacks, but you may find a use for them in your own code.
	In this case, we pass <code>someProcess()</code> a function, to be called later. Any variables that are
	in scope at the time that function is defined, will be accessible from inside it. But be careful with loops,
	because if you just refer to <code>i</code>, it may have already reached the end of the loop and be 10
	every time. That's why we store a copy in a new <code>var x</code> that creates a new variable (and a new scope)
	every time through the loop.
</p>

<h1 id="functions">Built in functions</h1>
<ul>
	<li><code>len(array/string)</code> returns the length of a string, or the number of elements in an array</li>
	<li><code>keys(object)</code> returns an array of all the named members / keys in a var.</li>
	<li><code>keycount(object)</code> returns the number of keys in an object.</li>
	<li><code>str()</code> converts values to string, although they kind of do that automatically in many cases</li>
	<li><code>chr(number)</code> returns the character at a given code point as a string. Example, <code>chr(65) == 'A'</code> </li>
	<li><code>codepoint(string)</code> returns the numerical code point of (the first character of) a string</li>
	<li><code>round(number, digits)</code> rounds to the nearest however many digits</li>
	<li><code>floor(number) and ceil(number)</code> floor and ceiling, round to the next integer</li>
	<li><code>substr(string, start, length)</code> returns [length] characters from [string] starting at [start]</li>
	<li><code>find(haystack_string, needle_string)</code> finds needle in haystack, returns 0-based position</li>
	<li><code>sqrt(x)</code> returns the square root of x</li>
	<li><code>log(x)</code> natural logarithm. To get the base-n log, use <code>log(x) / log(n)</code> </li>
	<li><code>sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, sinh, cosh, tanh</code> Trig functions</li>
	<li>* Most implementations should have a <code>print()</code> function, but that's a system call, not a language feature. It should return the output string.</li>
</ul>


<h1 id="performance">Performance</h1>
<p>
	Let's put it this way. I wouldn't suggest mining bitcoin with it. The philosophy here is to trade overall performance for cpu load granularity
	and ease of use. There's a lot of overhead for each instruction, although it's not really instructions you're dealing
	with in this language, it's tokens. Some tokens do more than others. The idea is that it might not finish as quickly as other more 
	optimized languages, but you can suspend it and do other stuff whenever you need to. And by you, I mean the system that's running the
	interpreter. In other words, the priority is to make it throttleable.
</p>
<p>
	There's one other glaring issue that bears pointing out. Variables are <strong>thicc</strong>.
	The fact that C# doesn't have unions is a big part of that. Another is that I don't want to make 10 derived classes because 
	source code size actually matters.
	This language is meant for every day people to do simple high level logic and call down to lower level APIs,
	it's not supposed to be powering a complex system that processes a lot of data.
